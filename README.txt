*****
This repository contains the dataset and source code for Prediction of Microalgae Growth Using Fennec Fox Optimization–XGBoost.
*****

Overview

The dataset and source code in this repository were used to develop and validate a hybrid machine learning model
that integrates Fennec Fox Optimization (FFO), implemented via the Mealpy library, with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for predicting microalgae growth.
The entire framework is implemented in Python, employing the XGBoost library for model training and evaluation.
Furthermore, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed using Tkinter to facilitate user interaction, data input, parameter configuration, and model execution.
*****

The input variables are including the nutrients of nitrate NO3-N (X1), orthophosphate PO4-P (X2), bicarbonate HCO3-C (X3), Glucose-C (X4), and age (X5).
The output variable is microalgae growth.

Users can reproduce the results of the study by running the provided PYTHON script with the dataset.
All variable names in the code correspond to the columns in dataset.csv.
